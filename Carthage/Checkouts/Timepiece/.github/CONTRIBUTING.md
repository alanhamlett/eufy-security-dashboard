## How to contribute
* We are welcome issues about bugs and pull requests to fix bugs.
* We are also welcome issues and pull requests about new features. But, we will not merge followings.
  * Adding new ways to do the same thing as existing features. More options this library gives, more comfusing it is.
  * Self-centered ideas such as a feature to support a rare usecase or a change of APIs for own readability.
* Labels are helpful to decide which issues we should put priority on.
